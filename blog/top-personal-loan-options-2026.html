    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Personal loans can be a great tool to consolidate debt, cover major purchases, or handle unexpected expenses. However, choosing the right loan can be tricky. With multiple lenders offering different interest rates, repayment terms, and fees, it’s essential to understand all your options before applying.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3 mt-6">1. Bank Personal Loans</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Traditional banks are often the first place people look for personal loans. They offer competitive interest rates, flexible repayment terms, and reliability. Banks usually require a good credit score and may have stricter eligibility requirements. Benefits include lower rates for existing customers and personalized customer service.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3 mt-6">2. Credit Union Loans</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Credit unions are member-owned institutions that often provide lower interest rates than banks. They may be more willing to work with borrowers with average credit scores. Joining a credit union can open the door to additional financial benefits and more personalized support.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3 mt-6">3. Online Lenders</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Online lenders have grown significantly in recent years. They offer convenience, fast approval processes, and often lower documentation requirements. Interest rates vary widely, so compare multiple online lenders before committing. Popular options include peer-to-peer platforms and fintech companies.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3 mt-6">4. Secured vs Unsecured Loans</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Secured loans require collateral, such as a car or savings account, which can lead to lower interest rates. Unsecured loans don’t require collateral but usually carry higher rates. Decide based on your financial situation and risk tolerance.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3 mt-6">5. Key Factors to Consider</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <li>Interest rates (fixed vs variable)</li>
      <li>Loan term and monthly repayment</li>
      <li>Fees and penalties</li>
      <li>Eligibility requirements</li>
      <li>Lender reputation and customer service</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3 mt-6">6. Tips for Choosing the Best Loan</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Before applying, compare multiple lenders. Use online calculators to estimate monthly payments and total costs. Check for hidden fees or prepayment penalties. Ensure the loan fits within your budget and financial goals.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3 mt-6">Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Selecting the right personal loan in 2026 requires careful research and planning. By understanding your options, comparing rates and terms, and borrowing responsibly, you can make a smart financial decision that supports your goals. Remember, the best loan is one that meets your needs while keeping your finances secure.
